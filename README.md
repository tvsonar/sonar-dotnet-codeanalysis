SonarLint is a Visual Studio 2015 extension that provides on-the-fly feedback to developers on new bugs and quality issues injected into C# code.

SonarLint has found real bugs in popular open-source C# projects such as [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/2237/files) and [NuGet](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet3/pull/41/files).

Download SonarLint from the [Visual Studio Gallery](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/47d1049d-bb27-454e-aab8-24566c85e548) to start using it today.
