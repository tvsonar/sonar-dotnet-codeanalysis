<p>
    The compiler automatically initializes class fields to their default values before setting them with any initialization
    values, so there is no need to explicitly set a field to its default value. Further, under the logic that cleaner code
    is better code, it's considered poor style to do so.

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
class X
{
  public int field = 0; // Noncompliant
  public object o = null; // Noncompliant
}
</pre>

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
class X
{
  public int field;
  public object o;
}
</pre>

<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<code>const</code> fields are ignored.
